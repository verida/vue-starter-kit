# Verida Vue Starter Kit

This starter kit is a template that helps developers get started easily using our Verida SSO (Single Sign On) Login.

This is currently a work-in-progress, alpha version. While the [core Verida APIs](https://developers.verida.io/docs/api/verida-js) are stable, the [vue-components](https://github.com/verida/verida-vue-components) are still under active development.

# How to use this

* Clone this repo and rename to your own project
* Edit the `.env` file to rename the [Application Context](https://developers.verida.io/docs/concepts/application-contexts)
* Look in `Home.vue` to see how to get access to the Verida Context and Account objects.
* Feedback is welcome, either in Discord or via the Gitub issue tracker.
